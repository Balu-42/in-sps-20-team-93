### Project Details

A Google App Engine project.

Delivery Network is a one stop portal where the user can get a real-time optimum arrangement for all the paths for making deliveries or planning a tourist-y retreat. Planning out such tasks can be cumbersome and time consuming. The aim of this project is to make planning out such tasks a friendlier and a more efficient process.

User can easily create a new delivery (or schedule a new task) with just a click. Additionally, a map is displayed on the page for userâ€™s ease of navigation.
The Admin Dashboard of the application is the front for the user's scheduled journey. All the different paths to travel are displayed sequentially on a map. A panel is made on the bottom of the screen that has buttons to move to previous or next paths which would help the user navigate.
